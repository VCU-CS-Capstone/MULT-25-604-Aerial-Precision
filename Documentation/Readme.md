# Documentation Folder

This folder contains primarily two resources -- a Technical Plan of Operations (TPO), and the 3D files created for the LiDAR payload

- The TPO contains a step-by-step guide to replicate the project as completed by the team, including accessing cloud-base photogrammetry software, sourcing and assembling the LiDAR payload, and data collection/flight operations for both drone systems.
- The 3D files are included as a way to simplify the replication or extension of this project, as they were flight-proven by the group and meet the needs of the project sufficiently.

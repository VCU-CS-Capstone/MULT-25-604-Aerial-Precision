# *Aerial Precision: 3D Reality Capture and GIS Integration with Drone Technology*
## *GeoDecisions*
## *Project Description*
The project aims to utilize spatial data collection and analysis by leveraging drone technology and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) systems to capture high-precision 3D models of physical environments. These models will be integrated with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to enhance spatial analysis, planning, and decision-making processes. Once integrated, we want to explore using machine learning and object detection to isolate features from the models.
